# python-gflags #

The `python-gflags` package contains a library that implements commandline flags processing.  As such it's a replacement for `getopt()`.

But before we get too far into that, here's a bit of news:

**[This is moving to GitHub](https://github.com/gflags/python-gflags)**

With Google Gode shutting down soon, `python-gflags` has moved its home there.  And while the project's been quiet lately, perhaps this will breathe in new life.  Here, this will remain in read-only mode until the plug is ultimately pulled.  So long, and thanks for all the commits!
